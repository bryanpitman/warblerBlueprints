What is Flask Blueprints ?

Blueprints provide the ability to divide up a large application into separate python files. By portioning the application into smaller pieces, each piece/component can pass separate views and render templates from different parts of our application.


What are the benefits of Flask Blueprints?

Using Flask Blueprints will allow for expanded features to be added easily since each feature of Warbler can have its own separate file. Creating these separate files/mini apps for each feature will simplify unit testing while making the code base easier to navigate.

How does Flask Blueprints compare to Express Router?
